What is "Context" in LLMs?
Context means:
👉 Everything you’ve said (or written) so far in a conversation or prompt
It helps the model understand what you mean now based on what came before.

🔸 Real-Life Example:
You say:

"What's the capital of India?"

Then later say:

"What about China?"

If there were no context, I’d be confused.
But with context, I know you're still asking about capitals — so I reply:

"The capital of China is Beijing."

✅ Context helped me understand what “What about China?” means.



🔹 How much context can I remember?
Every LLM has a context window, like a memory span. For example:

GPT-3.5 could handle ~4,000 tokens (about 2,500–3,000 words)

GPT-4 can go up to 128,000 tokens (that's about 300 pages!)

So I can remember a LOT — but if you go beyond my limit, I may "forget" the start.

🔹 Why is context important?
It keeps conversations flowing naturally
You don’t need to repeat everything again and again.

It helps with multi-step reasoning
Like solving a math word problem with many steps.

It helps maintain memory within a session
Like when you say “my resume” or “the report” — I know what you mean.
